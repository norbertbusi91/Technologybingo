1. **Time tracking system 1.**

**A tool for a company, where users (employees of the company) can log how much did they work on different tasks, while they were on-site in the office. All employees have a dedicated computer.**

In that case I recommend to develop an application. If they have a dedicated computer, then there will be no problem with system requirements. Apps are better for regular usage, and for personalization. It is also more usable for complex calculations, charts, reporting. They can use the app even if it&#39;s offline. The basic content and functionality is available.

2. **Time tracking system 2.**

**A tool for a company, where users (employees of the company) can log how much did they work on different tasks, while they were either on- or off-site (either at home office, or at clients). You can safely assume that they have internet access at all times.**

For that system, a website is perfectly enough, and also cheaper to develop, and even to maintain. They don&#39;t have to download an application, if they just want to check in from an internet caffe, or a library or at clients. It&#39;s all sorted, if they have internet acces all the time.

3. **Precision agriculture sensor system**

**A farmer wants to know the humidity on each acres of her farm which is a contiguous area of one km^2. She would like to see the measurements on her ipad.**

Here we need to use IOT apps, and sensors. IOT is a platform where embedded devices are connecting to the internet, so they can collect and exchange data with each other. It enables devices to interact, collaborate and lear n from each others experiences.

We need to use humidity sensor, then we need to make an IOS mobile app with it for the dear user, then she can track the humidity level.

These sensors usually follow the use of temperature sensors, as many manufacturing processes require perfect working conditions. Through measuring humidity, you can ensure that the whole process runs smoothly, and when there is any sudden change, action can be taken immediately, as sensors detect the change almost instantaneously.

4. **A 3D-heavy FPS game**

**A 3D-heavy, single player FPS game, where your goal is to kill the unicorn king.**

For a highly interactive game like this, we will defenitely need an application. I would prefer Android over IOS. IOS has more limitations, and a review time is 4 days, but Android has no such a thing as limitation, and the review time is only 0.5 hours to 5 hours.

5. **Notes app**

**Software which is capable of saving your notes while you&#39;re on the go. It should be able to process speech to text, and handdrawing.**

**When it comes online, it should be able to sync your notes across all your devices.**

We will need a hybrid app for that. WIth this, only one platform is enough to build in a new feature, or make update. So with this opportunity it will be possible to sync your notes across all your devices.

6. **Smart mirror**

**An augmented reality application, with what you can try on virtually designed clothes and jewellery.**

A mobile app ismaking use of mobile device features, like the camera. In that case you will be able the make a photo of yourself, and with these features, you can just swipe the clothes and jewellery right on your photo.

7. **A blog**

**A blog which can be edited from any device (given the right screen size, and the adequate peripherials) on-line.**

A website is perfectly enught for that project. There is no need to download any application, so acces to the internet is the only thing you need.

8. **Mobile version of an existing marketplace**

**There&#39;s an online marketplace, built using PHP, with millions of products, a plethora of shopping and delivery modes, and it is being developed for 10 years. Now the management wants to build a mobile version.**

It is always good to make an application of a website for special purposes and features. The shipping and delivery going to be more trackable. The whole process will be easier.

It has better personalization as it&#39;s offering tailored communication to users based on their interest, and it can track and observe user engagement, custom reccomendations.

An application is also faster, because it uses local data from the device, while the website uses web servers. Moreover the applications framework is 5 times faster then the web&#39;s javascript.

It can be even more designable then a website with limited options.

**Bear in mind that developing a website is less time consuming then developing an application, and also cheaper.**
